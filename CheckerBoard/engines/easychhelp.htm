The easy checkers engine is an intentionally weak checkers engine for CheckerBoard. It is artificially slowed down to search something like 100 positions per second, and it has an evaluation function with lots of wrong notions, such as that evacuating the back rank is a good idea. However, if it sees a way to grab material, such as a 2-for-1-shot, it will play it. 

<p>
Easy checkers displays some information about its search in the status bar. From left to right it displays the best move, the time used, the search depth in ply (one ply is one move of one side, so if both sides make one move, thats two ply), the evaluation as seen from the point of view of black, so a negative evaluation means that simple checkers thinks white is better, and then some statistics on the search tree: the number of nodes, the number of generated movelists (gms), the number of generated capturelists (gcs), and the number of position evaluations (evals).

Have fun!
