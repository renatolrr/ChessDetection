<h3>Suicidal Cake Help</h3>

Suicidal Cake plays the suicide variant of checkers. In this
variant, the player to lose wins - your goal is to lose all your pieces (or not
be able to make a move). All other rules are like in English
checkers. 
<p>
Like regular checkers, the game appears to be drawish - but it allows a lot of nice tactics. 
<p>
Suicidal Cake comes with the 4-piece endgame database. I have computed the entire 8-piece database
for the computation of the opening book, because a lot of very lopsided positions are in fact drawn,
because neither side can approach the other's pieces due to losing tactics.
<p>
You can download a smallish opening book for Suicidal Cake on my <a href="http://www.fierz.ch/download.php">
checkers download page</a>.
