<h3>Kingscourt Cake Help</h3>

Kingscourt Cake plays (not suprisingly) the Kingscourt variant of checkers. In this
variant, the first player to crown a man wins. The other rules are like in English
checkers. Obviously, unlike in regular checkers,
there is always a winner in Kingscourt. I have used this engine to solve the game, 
i.e. to find out whether black or white will win the game. Kingscourt Cake currently
comes without an opening book, and because of the nature of the game, it also has
no endgame databases. Nevertheless, it should be a tough opponent!
