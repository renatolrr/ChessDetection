<h3><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h3>

Checkers, or English draughts, was probably invented in the 
south of France in the 12th century. The first book in English 
on the game, William Payne’s <em>An Introduction to the Game of 
Draughts</em>, was published in 1756 - well over 1,000 books, 
pamphlets and journals have appeared since! -, and the world 
match championship was established in 1840. Scottish players 
dominated the game until the early part of the 20th century, 
with the USA leading the way ever since. In 5 matches contested 
between the USA and the UK & Ireland between 1973 and 2001, 
the former won them all, with an aggregate score of 324 wins, 
81 losses and 595 draws.

Diagram 1: The Starting Position<br>
<img src="nutshellgif\diagram1.gif"><br>
Black to move.
</center>

<P>
A move is recorded by means of two numbers separated by a 
hyphen; the numbers signifying the squares on which a particular 
piece starts and finishes. In actual play the black squares are 
used, but in all publications the white squares are employed for 
clarity.
<P>
Although one of the key attractions of the game, especially for 
young children, is its simplicity of form, ‘Move on the black 
squares and jump when you can!’ summing things up succinctly, 
 ironically very few people are familiar with the rules. Here
 are the most important ones:
<UL>
<LI>In play, the board is arranged, like chess, with a black square 
in the bottom left-hand corner.
<LI>Black always move first.
<LI><b>All jumps must be taken! There are no ifs, buts or ands!</b>
 (If a player has a choice of jumps, he may select any one he 
wishes; not necessarily that which gains the most pieces.)
<LI>
Men can jump kings.
<LI>
When a man reaches the final row of the board (king-row) it 
becomes a king, and the player’s move terminates.  Kings 
can move both backwards and forwards.
<LI>
A player wins either by removing all his opponent’s pieces from the board or by rendering them immobile. That is, ‘Last move wins!’
</UL>


<h3><a name="basics"></a>Basics</H3>

<b>FORCE has an important role to play in checkers. Namely, 
in a free and open position, the gain of a single piece is enough 
to ensure a won game; the loss of a piece will lose the game.</b>
 There are numerous ways of gaining a piece in checkers, the most 
common of which are the 2 for 1 and the 3 for 2.

<p>
<center>
Diagram 2: 2 for 1<br>
<img src="nutshellgif\diagram2.gif"><br>
White to move and win
</center>
<p>
Note: throughout this guide,  everything is viewed from White’s 
standpoint. Naturally all the ideas given apply with equal force 
to the black pieces.  In Diagram 2 White wins with … 24-19; 15-24
 28-12. 
<p>
<center>
Diagram 3: 3 for 2<br>
<img src="nutshellgif\diagram3.gif"><br>
White to move and win
</center>
<p>
In Diagram 3 White wins with … 18-15; 11-18 27-23; 18-27 (or 19-26)
 31-6.

<b>
Having got a piece ahead the basic winning policy is to make a
 series of judicious (non position-weakening) exchanges (such 
as giving up 1 to take 1) until the situation is reduced to one 
of those given in Diagrams 4 and 5.
</b>
<p>
<center>
Diagram 4: 2 Kings v 1 King<br>
<img src="nutshellgif\diagram4.gif"><br>
White to move and win
</center>
<P>
The winning procedure falls into three parts: 
1) The two kings force the lone king back into the 
‘double-corner’ (here, squares 28 & 32) -  if it retreats 
elsewhere there follows instant defeat. 2) One of the two 
kings enters the double-corner, forcing the lone king out. 
3) The lone king is pinned on the side of the board.  
Thus from Diagram 4 White wins with … 9-14; 15-19 6-10; 
19-23 10-15; 23-27 14-18; 27-24 18-23; 24-28 15-19; 28-32 
19-24; 32-28 23-19; 28-32 24-28; 32-27 28-32; 27-31 19-15; 
31-26 15-18; 26-31 18-22.

<p>
<center>
Diagram 5: 3 Kings v 2 Kings<br>
<img src="nutshellgif\diagram5.gif"><br>
White to move and win
</center>
<p>
In Diagram 5 the win is swiftly effected by constantly 
threatening, and eventually forcing, a 1 for 1 exchange; 
reducing the situation to that given in Diagram 4. The 
defender, of course, tries to avoid this. White continues
 …15-18; 9-5 (9-13 loses quickly by 10-14) 10-6; 27-32 
(if 5-1, White replies with 18-15) 19-23 (threatening 6-9);
 5-1 (Black must move out of the way) 6-9; 32-28 (if 1-5, 
White replies with 9-14 creating the threat of two 1 for 1 
exchanges on his next move) 23-27 (forming the key position); 
1-5 (28-32 amounts to the same thing) 27-23; 5-14 18-9. 
Mission accomplished!



<H3><a name="endgame"></a>Endgame</H3>


<b>‘An endgame is a game ending, in which both sides have 
achieved a king; or at least have gained a clear run to the 
king-row.’ (Derek Oldbury)</b>
<p>

Success in the endgame depends in part upon the correct a
pplication of general principles and partly upon a thorough 
understanding of certain key situations.
<p>

General Principle Number 1: <b>Try and get ahead in development. 
In the late midgame and endgame it is an advantage for your men, 
taken as a whole, to be further advanced up the board than your 
opponent, and exchanges which serve to boost your pull in this 
aspect of TIME should be sought.</b> Achieving a particular goal or
objective before your opponent may only be possible if you have 
this edge.
<p>

General Principle Number 2: <b>Position your kings judiciously.</b>
 Namely, you should centralise them, connect them and, when 
crowning several kings on a crowded board, ensure this is 
done without any wasted motion. 
<p>

General Principle Number 3: <b>Be alert to the ways in which one 
king can hold two pieces.</b> For example (Black to move in all cases),
 a white king on 14 defeats two black men on 5 and 13; a white king
 on 19 draws against a black man on 12 and a black king on 20; A 
white king on 23 defeats a black man on 28 and a black king on 32. 
And so on.
<p>

Key Situation Number 1: First Position.
<p>
<center>
Diagram 6: First Position<br>
<img src="nutshellgif\diagram6.gif"><br>
White to move and win
</center>
<p>

Diagram 6 represents but one specific example of a generalised 
situation known as First Position. It is characterised by the 
following features: 1) White has the ‘opposition’. This means 
‘to be in a position to check the advance of opposing pieces 
beyond a certain point.’ (Derek Oldbury) Pair off 12 and 19
 (there is one intervening square), mentally move 23-27 and
 you will see that White has the opposition. 2) At least one
 of Black’s pieces is a single man. 3) White has, or can develop,
 two kings, while keeping Black’s single man pinned to the 
right-hand side of the board. 4) Black’s other piece, which 
becomes a king in the double-corner, is unable to reach the 
opposite double-corner. <b>White’s winning procedure</b>, the
 details of which are beyond the scope of this guide,
 <b>consists of attacking Black’s king, immobilising it,
 and forcing Black’s single man to advance into trouble. </b>
Black naturally tries to delay this advance for as long as
 possible.

<p>
Key Situation Number 2: Second Position.
<p>
<center>
Diagram 7: Second Position<br>

<img src="nutshellgif\diagram7.gif"><br>
White to move and win
</center>
<p>
Again, Diagram 7 represents just one specific example of a 
generalised situation known as Second Position. Its  
characteristic features are: 1) White has the opposition. 
2) One of the black men is held on 21, and the other on 
the opposite side of the board. 3) The third black piece 
is, or can become, a king, although its scope is severely
 limited. <b>The winning procedure,</b> though lengthy, is very
 mechanical, and <b>consists of</b> three phases: <b>1) Crowning 
three kings, while keeping the two black men pinned to the 
sides of the board. 2) Exchanging off the black king; 
changing the opposition in the process. 3) Exchanging 
off the black man on the right-hand side of the board
 and regaining the opposition.</b>


<H3><a name="midgame"></a>Midgame</H3>

‘The climactic point of the midgame is reached when the 
defender has completed his defensive combination or, in 
cases where the defence has been unsuccessful, the attacker 
has completed his winning combination. After this climactic
 point is reached, the midgame structures begin to melt away
 leading to the endgame.’ (Maurice Chamblee) <b>The early midgame 
</b>(arguably the most important part of the game)<b> leads from 
the opening up to the climactic point; the late midgame leads
 from the climactic point to the start of the endgame. 
(If indeed there is one.)</b>
<p>
LATE MIDGAME
<p>
<center>
Diagram 8: Fifth Position<br>
<img src="nutshellgif\diagram8.gif"><br>
White to move and draw
</center>
<p>
Fifth position is one of the classic late midgame positions. 
It has arisen on thousands of occasions, and an understanding 
of its key points is essential. From Diagram 8 White continues
 … 20-16! (Black was threatening 11-15); 11-20 27-23; 20-24 
22-18; 24-27 18-9; 10-14 9-6; 27-31 6-2; 31-27 2-6; 27-18 6-9; 
13-17 19-15; 18-11 9-18; 17-22 18-25; 11-15 25-22! Drawn. 
At the last move, 21-17? would lose. Can you see why?   
<p>
EARLY MIDGAME
<p>
Here again a grasp of general principles is crucial, as is 
an understanding of key formations.

General Principle Number 1: <b>Try and gain at least equal 
control of the centre</b>; represented by squares 14, 15, 18 
and 19.<br>

General Principle Number 2: <b>Don’t underestimate the value 
of side moves.</b> Although limited to moving in just one 
direction, as opposed to two in the centre, a man on the side 
is immune from capture and can be used both for supporting and 
‘cramping’ purposes. For example, a white man on 13 can support
 an advanced man on 9 and, in conjunction with a man on 18 can
 be used to impose a cramp -  restriction of mobility - on Black’s 
double-corner. Likewise, a white man on 20 can be used to support
 a man which has infiltrated on 16 and, in conjunction with 
a man on 18 can be used to impose a cramp on Black’s single 
corner. Also, an exchange at the side can be effected  with 
just two men. (Three in the centre.)<br>

General Principle Number 3: <b>Develop your single-corner men
 (those on 21, 22, 25 and 29) rapidly.</b> This is because, 
with only one entry square to the king-row, this area of the 
board is less vulnerable to attack than the double-corner.

<br>
General Principle Number 4: <b>Protect your double-corner 
(24, 27, 28 and 32).</b> Set the board up ready for play, 
and remove the four men in the double-corner. You’ll see how
 vulnerable it is!
<br>

General Principle Number 5: <b>Be completely flexible 
regarding the movement of the men in your king-row;</b>
 definitely don’t make it a rule to retain them all! 
However, retaining two men on 30 and 31, particularly in
 conjunction with the ‘apex man’ on 26, forms a very sturdy
 defensive structure, and is worth remembering. Moving 
the man on 31 early often leads to a structural weakness.
<br>

General Principle Number 6: <b>Don’t overdevelop your men. 
In the opening and early midgame it is usually disadvantageous
 for your men to be further advanced than your opponent’s -
 you might run out of moves!</b>

<br>
<b>
The early midgame largely operates in the element of SPACE 
and is fundamentally about formations.</b>
<p>
Key Formation Number 1: The Long Dyke
<p>
<center>
Diagram 9: The Long Dyke Formation<br>
<img src="nutshellgif\diagram9.gif"><br>
</center>
<p>
Screening out all the other men on the board, Diagram 9 
represents a fully developed long dyke formation. <b>This is 
essentially an aggressive formation </b>because it is directed 
towards the opponent’s double-corner, <b>and the purpose of 
the dyking player is to dominate the centre and force the 
opponent’s men on to inferior squares at the side of the board.</b>
<p>
Key Formation Number 2: The Pyramid.
<p>
<center>
Diagram 10: The Pyramid Formation<br>
<img src="nutshellgif\diagram10.gif">
</center>
<p>
Screening out all the other men on the board, Diagram 10 
represents a ‘fully developed’ pyramid formation. (Actually 
these six men haven’t moved!) <b>This is a very defensive
 formation which</b>, unlike the long dyke, <b>can be employed 
by both players simultaneously.</b> During the course of the
 game it is often reduced to just three men on 26, 30 and 
31 as mentioned earlier, and then just to the man on 31. 









<H3><a name="opening"></a>Opening</H3>
<b>‘The opening is an initial combination of moves, 
fully executed, resulting in the achievement of 
definite, complete, preliminary objectives by both 
sides.’ (Maurice Chamblee)</b> At the start of the game
 the forces are of course equal, but the advantage
 of having the first move means that Black possesses 
the initiative. The seven possible initial moves are 
given here in order of strength, together with White’s 
seven possible replies to each one in strength order.

<UL>
<LI>
<b>Strongest 11-15:</b> Exits from the single-corner towards 
the centre. <b>Replies:</b> 23-19, 22-17, 23-18, 24-20,
 22-18, 24-19 and 21-17 (allows Black to cramp with 9-13 at
 the next move).

<LI>
<b> 9-14:</b> Towards the centre, but exiting from the more
 vulnerable double-corner. <b>Replies:</b> 22-18, 22-17, 24-20, 
24-19, 23-19, 23-18 (horrible!) and 21-17? (loses!).

<LI>
<b>11-16:</b> Moving from the single-corner, but
 directed to the side. <b>Replies:</b> 22-18, 23-18, 24-19,
 22-17, 21-17, 24-20 and 23-19 (horrible!).

<LI>
<b>10-15:</b> Towards the centre, but from the double-corner,
 and opens up a ‘hole’ on 10.<b> Replies:</b> 21-17, 22-17, 22-18, 
23-18, 23-19, 24-19 and 24-20.

<LI>
<b>10-14:</b> A flanking move which allows White several
 good replies. <b>Replies: 24-19, 22-18, 22-17, 23-19, 24-20, 
23-18 (not nice!) and 21-17? (loses!).

<LI>
<b>12-16:</b> Ranks 6th in strength purely because White 
can cramp Black’s single-corner with the immediate 24-20.
<b> Replies:</b> 24-20, 22-18, 23-18, 24-19, 22-17, 21-17 and
 23-19 (horrible!).

<LI>
<b>Weakest 9-13:</b> Exits from the double-corner to the
 side.<b> Replies:</b> 22-18, 24-19, 23-18, 23-19, 24-20, 22-17
 and 21-17 (allows Black to cramp with 11-15 at the next
 move).
